#### Pair Problem #1

You are given the following three documents:

```python
text = ["wookie stormtrooper",
        "wookie wookie wookie stormtrooper stormtrooper stormtrooper",
        "harry potter"]
```

 * Transform this data into a bag of words representation, with simple counts. How informative is this format? How much information do you have about individual words?
 * Calculate Euclidean and cosine distances between each pair of documents. How do these distances relate to your intuition for the documents' similarities?
 * Calculate one minus the cosine distance between each pair of de-meaned documents, and the Pearson correlation coefficient between each pair of documents. How are they related? Is this a coincidence? Find a counterexample or prove that there isn't one.



#### Pair Problem #2

Imagine a data matrix with three rows and two columns. Each row represents an observation, and each column represents a feature. (This is our usual convention.)

Imagine subtracting out the column means.

Imagine multiplying the transpose of this matrix by itself.

Don't just imagine itâ€”write this out!

What familiar calculation is this? What result have you produced?

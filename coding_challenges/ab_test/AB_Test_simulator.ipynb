    "We are trying to improve the proportion of defects we have when manufacturing Banana cell phones. We have some data on two different processes we want to try and use, which we call `process0` (our current process) and `process1` (the new process). It is expensive to switch to `process1` unless we are reasonably sure it makes a substaintial improvement in the rates. We will make a small production line at one factory, and run a batch of size `N` through both processes. We are employing you to help us scope out how large a batch `N` we need."

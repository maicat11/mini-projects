# Pair Problem

__Generate the numbers 1 to 100__.

Do the above via list comprehension; then do it by using [`map`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.map.html) and `filter` (hint: use lambda functions):

 * Square the numbers.
 * Select just the squares that are odd.

What does `reduce` do? Use it to do the following:

 * Add up the numbers 1 to 100.
 * Square the numbers.
 * Select just the numbers that are odd.

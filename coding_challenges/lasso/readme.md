#### Pair Problem

**Write a program that will play tic-tac-toe against a human opponent.**

This is a challenging problem. Feel free to team up with another pair. Groups of 4 or 5 is totally fine. Maybe two people on a team can work on the data structure and implementation while the others can work on the heuristics.

Your program doesn't have to perfect. Start with something as simple as random, then maybe build a program that wouldn't blatantly lose. And then go for the win. Have fun with it.

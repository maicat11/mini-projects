#### Pair Problem #1

Given a string, write a function to reverse it. Do this using a loop, if possible.

    reverseString('abcdef') will return 'fedcba'
    reverseString('moon') will return 'noom'

#### Pair Problem #2

Sal's classroom has a bag of alphabet magnets. She wants to know if she can spell her friend's name using the letters in the bag. Write a function that will take a list of letters and a name and print out yes if the name can be spelled and no otherwise.

    CanYouSpell(['y','n','p','g','n','l'],"lynn") would print YES
    CanYouSpell(['y','n','p','g','l'],"lynn") would print NO

When you are done, submit to the Slack channel.

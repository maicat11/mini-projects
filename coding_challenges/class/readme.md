# Pair Problem: Write a KNN Class from Scratch

>Note: you can use Monday to finish Tic-Tac-Toe if it's not ready.

This is another challenging problem, so feel free to team up or compare with another pair.

Create a `Class KNearestNeighbor()` and populate it with the basic methods, including `predict:`. Default to `euclidean` distance but include `manhattan` if you can. We will then provide a validation csv file to run through your model and check against our benchmark.

This is as much an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) exercise as it is data science, so these resources will be helpful:

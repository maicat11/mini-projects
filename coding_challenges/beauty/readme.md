# Pair Problem

When John was a little kid he didnâ€™t have much to do. There was no internet, no Facebook, and no programs to hack on. So he did the only thing he couldâ€¦ he evaluated the beauty of strings in a quest to discover the most beautiful string in the world.

Given a string `s`, little Johnny defined the beauty of the string as the sum of the beauty of the letters in it. The beauty of each letter is an integer between 1 and 26, inclusive, and no two letters have the same beauty. Johnny doesnâ€™t care about whether letters are uppercase or lowercase, so that doesnâ€™t affect the beauty of a letter. (Uppercase â€˜Fâ€™ is exactly as beautiful as lowercase â€˜fâ€™, for example.)

#### Sort, sort, sort!

**1) Write a function to sort a given list: def mySort(inputlist)**

I'm sure you have heard of many sorting algorithms. But don't worry about the terminologies and efficiencies. And don't google. *Just write a sort function that works.* Then ask what's the complexity of your function?

**2) I want to keep my list sorted and do find, insert and delete operations on it. Write the following functions. It's okay if you don't get to complete all these functions. Just think about your approach and what the complexity would be.**

    def find(sortedlist,number): # this would return the index of the given number if it is in the list or -1.
    def insert(sortedlist,number): # this would insert the number into the list at the right position.
    def remove(sortedlist,number): # this would remove the the given number if it is in the list.

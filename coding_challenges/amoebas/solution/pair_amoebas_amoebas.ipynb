    "At time zero there is one amoeba in a petri dish.  It splits with probability ps.  With probability 1-ps it dies without splitting, and its entire line (only itself at this point) is eliminated.  If it splits, on the other hand, it produces two amoeba that both live to next period (period 1.) At period 1, if there are any amoeba, each has a probability ps of splitting and 1-ps of dying without splitting.  This occurs again and again as long as there are amoeba in the dish; at evenly spaced intervals, if there are any amoeba left, each one splits and survives with probability ps and dies without splitting with probability 1-ps.  What is the probability that the amoeba line continues forever, if ps = 3/4? if ps = 1/2? if ps = 9/10?"

Let ps be the probability of any one amoeba splitting at any time t, and let P be the probability of the entire amoeba line surviving forever.  Give that the first amoeba successfully splits, the line will continue to infinity if at least one of the offspring produces an infinite line.  But each one of the offspring will have an identical likelihood of producing an infinite line as the first one did; i.e., each one produces an infinite line with probability P.  The only way the line would stop in finite time is if _**both**_ of the two offspring terminates in finite time.  Since these are independent events, this happens with probability (1-P)^2.

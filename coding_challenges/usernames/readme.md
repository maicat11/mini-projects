*This is a tough problem. If you are stuck, please ask an instructor for help.*

If you're named Danny Kyung or Matthew Emes, it opens up the possibility of justifying your use of usernames such as [dank](https://github.com/dank) or [memes](https://github.com/memes).
Your task is to find the longest word such that it satisfies the criteria - that is, it is a substring of the given string but not necessarily consecutively (we can call it a sparse substring). If there are multiple words of same maximum length, output all of them.
You may use the the [Enable word list](http://norvig.com/ngrams/enable1.txt), or some other reasonable English word list. Every word in your output must appear in your word list.

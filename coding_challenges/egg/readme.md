There is a building with 100 floors. You have two eggs. If either egg is dropped from the **K**th floor or above it will break. If it's dropped from any of the floors below, it wouldn't break, however many times you dropped it. We need to find the cut-off floor **K**. How many tries would you need before you can find that floor?
